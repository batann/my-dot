captcher keysequence for navigation, while a-z keys narrow down options to letters Entered

to achieve that the main while loop would have to captcher each key-stroke and in case of a letter it would have to be captchured in a variable that the options are being filtered through
additional thoughts:"Variable $Example holds the key (eg. e ) options including letter e could be filtered with grep, where by an additional value is determind by the position of the key within the option, closer to the beginig the higher the value eg
option1="xexxxxx"
option2="xxxxxe"

option1
